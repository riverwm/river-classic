# river-classic

river-classic is a dynamic tiling Wayland compositor with flexible runtime
configuration. It is a fork of [river](https://codeberg.org/river/river) 0.3
intended for users that are happy with how river 0.3 works and do not wish to
deal with the majorly breaking changes planned for the river 0.4.0 release.

## Features

river-classic's window management style is quite similar to
[dwm](http://dwm.suckless.org), [xmonad](https://xmonad.org), and other classic
dynamic tiling X11 window managers. Windows are automatically arranged in a tiled
layout and shifted around as windows are opened/closed.

Rather than having the tiled layout logic built into the compositor process,
river-classic uses a [custom Wayland
protocol](https://codeberg.org/river/river-classic/src/branch/master/protocol/river-layout-v3.xml)
and separate "layout generator" process. A basic layout generator, `rivertile`,
is provided but users are encouraged to use community-developed [layout
generators](https://codeberg.org/river/wiki/src/branch/master/pages/Community-Layouts.md)
or write their own. Examples in C and Python may be found
[here](https://codeberg.org/river/river-classic/src/branch/master/contrib).

Tags are used to organize windows rather than workspaces. A window may be
assigned to one or more tags. Likewise, one or more tags may be displayed on a
monitor at a time.

River is configured at runtime using the `riverctl` tool. It can define
keybindings, set the active layout generator, configure input devices, and more.
On startup, river-classic runs a user-defined init script which usually runs
`riverctl` commands to set up the user's configuration.

## Building

Note: If you are packaging river-classic for distribution, see [PACKAGING.md](PACKAGING.md).

To compile river-classic first ensure that you have the following dependencies
installed. The "development" versions are required if applicable to your
distribution.

- [zig](https://ziglang.org/download/) 0.15
- wayland
- wayland-protocols
- [wlroots](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wlroots/wlroots) 0.19
- xkbcommon
- libevdev
- pixman
- pkg-config
- scdoc (optional, but required for man page generation)

Then run, for example:
```
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe --prefix ~/.local install
```
To enable Xwayland support pass the `-Dxwayland` option as well.
Run `zig build -h` to see a list of all options.

## Usage

River can either be run nested in an X11/Wayland session or directly
from a tty using KMS/DRM. Simply run the `river` command.

On startup river-classic will run an executable file at `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/river/init`
if such an executable exists. If `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is not set,
`~/.config/river/init` will be used instead.

Usually this executable is a shell script invoking *riverctl*(1) to create
mappings, start programs such as a layout generator or status bar, and
perform other configuration.

An example init script with sane defaults is provided [here](example/init)
in the example directory.

For complete documentation see the `river(1)`, `riverctl(1)`, and
`rivertile(1)` man pages.
